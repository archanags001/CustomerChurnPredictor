# CustomerChurnPredictor
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn using machine learning. By doing this, we can identify which customers are likely to leave the company, enabling the business to take proactive steps to retain them. Our target variable, **Churn**, indicates whether a customer has left or not. We aim to create an accurate and interpretable model to predict this.

## Data Details

I used the dataset "WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv", which is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data). This dataset contains information about customers, including various features like their subscription details, payment methods, and tenure, along with whether they churned or not.

The dataset has several important features, such as:

* **Tenure**: The number of months the customer has been with the company.
* **MonthlyCharges**: The amount the customer is billed monthly.
* **TotalCharges**: The total amount the customer has been billed during their entire time with the company.
* **Churn**: The target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (True) or not (False).
